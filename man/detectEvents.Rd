  x,

\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame, data which shall be classified as event or not}

\item{windowSize}{amount of data points to consider in each prediction model}

\item{nIterationsRefit}{amount of points into the future which will be predicted without fitting a new model.
E.g. if nIterationsRefit = 10 then the next five dataPoints are classified without refitting.}

\item{verbosityLevel}{Print output of function progress. 0 -> No output,
1 -> every 100th model building iteration, 2 -> every 10th, 3 -> every iteration}

\item{dataPrepators}{string or vector of strings, that defines which preparators to use.
Lists are not accepted. Usage Example: dataPreparators = "ImputeTSInterpolation" results in the usage of
imputeTS::na.interpolation as a data preparator. All possible preparators are listed via:
getSupportedPreparations()}

\item{dataPreparationControl}{list, control-list containing all additional parameters that shall be passed
to the dataPreparators.}

\item{buildModelAlgo}{string, model name to be used. All possible preparators
are listed via: getSupportedModels().}

\item{buildForecastModelControl}{list, control-list containing all additional parameters that shall be passed to the  forecast modelling algo.}

\item{buildNeuralNetModelControl}{list, control-list containing all additional parameters that shall be passed to the neuralnet modelling algo.}

\item{postProcessors}{string or vector of strings, that defines which postProcessors to use.
Lists are not accepted. Usage Example: postProcessors = "bedAlgo" results in the usage of
bed as a event postProcessing tool. All possible preparators are listed via:
getSupportedPostProcessors()}

\item{postProcessorControl}{list, control-list containing all additional parameters that shall be passed
to the postProcessirs.}

\item{ignoreVarianceWarning}{Ignores the continously appearing warning for missing variance in some variable
columns given a smaller windowSize}
}
\value{
edsResults edObject, list of results. $classification -> data.frame containing the T/F event classification
}
\description{
detectEvents builds a prediction model (edObject) on the first 'windowSize' points of the given data x.
The next 'nIterationRefit' data-points are classified as 'Event' or not.
The window is moved iteratively and the next models are fitted.
The first 'windowSize' points will always be classified as no Event and should only contain 'clean' data
}
\examples{
## Run event detection with default settings:
def <- detectEvents(x = stationBData[1:100,-1])

\donttest{
## Refit the model at every new datapoint,
## have someoutput with verbosityLevel = 2 and ignore
## the variance warning
ed <- detectEvents(stationBData[1:110,-1],nIterationsRefit = 1,
                   verbosityLevel = 2,ignoreVarianceWarning = TRUE)

## Switch to another model: Arima
ed2 <- detectEvents(stationBData[1:110,-1],nIterationsRefit = 1,
                    verbosityLevel = 0,ignoreVarianceWarning = TRUE,
                    buildModelAlgo = "ForecastArima")

   ## Switch to multivariate model: NeuralNetwork
ed3 <- detectEvents(stationBData[1:110,-1],nIterationsRefit = 1, buildModelAlgo = "NeuralNetwork")
                    }
